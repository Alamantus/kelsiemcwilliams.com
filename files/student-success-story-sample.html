  <strong>Writing Center at CU Denver<br />
  Student Success Story: Haiyue Liu</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The Tivoli Turnhalle is bustling, alive with the sounds of traditional Chinese
  music and friendly conversation. With microphone in hand, Haiyue Liu
  prepares to take the stage and welcome over 200 CU Denver students and
  faculty members to the Mid-Autumn Banquet hosted by the Intercultural Club
  Beijing (ICB). But her role as President of ICB is just one of the many
  impressive accomplishments listed on Liu&rsquo;s extensive resume.
</p>
<p>
  Before running for president, Liu, a senior at CU Denver majoring in
  communication, had been volunteering for ICB for a year. &ldquo;The club helps
  Chinese, especially ICB, students to have a better life and living environment
  in Denver,&rdquo; said Liu. &ldquo;The first time I came to Denver, I just didn&rsquo;t know
  where to go. I just knew how to get from Campus Village to campus, so the
  first month in Denver was tough.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  But Liu has decided to use her own experience adapting to an entirely new
  environment in order to help other students in the same position. &ldquo;After I got
  used to all the things on campus, like a lot of resources and help from all
  around, life is easy now. That&rsquo;s why I want to share these resources with
  other people,&rdquo; said Liu.
</p>
<p>
  In order to be elected, Liu needed to campaign and introduce herself to both
  ICB students and their American friends. As she explained, the campaign
  involved &ldquo;pasting papers on the wall so that ICB students and their American
  friends could go through them and find which one they think is the best.&rdquo; She
  came to the Writing Center so that she could showcase her strengths and
  qualifications in her biography. And as it turns out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only one who
  used English for the election,&rdquo; Liu said.
</p>
<p>
  Now that she has been elected president, Liu aims to help not just ICB
  students but all UCD students to utilize valuable campus resources while
  providing them with a welcoming environment and supportive community. As
  Liu explained, &ldquo;Every semester we will plan or schedule a lot of events like
  some traditional Chinese festivals. Otherwise, we will find some resources on
  campus for our students, like the Writing Center, advisors, or the Career
  Center.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  But what might convince other ICB and UCD students is that Liu herself has
  taken advantage of and benefited from them. &ldquo;Because my major is
  communication, I have a lot of writing and papers and presentations. I
  developed a really practical language experience from the Writing Center. My
  English that I learned in China from the textbooks is not &lsquo;real,&rsquo; so the Writing
  Center helped me to develop a language for life,&rdquo; she said.

  Liu is on track to graduate in May 2014, but until then, she will continue
  utilizing the Writing Center for assistance with her personal statement and
  resume as part of her application for graduate school.
