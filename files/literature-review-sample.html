  <strong>Narratives, Representations, and Artifacts of Trauma: A Literature Review</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The scholarship on the rhetoric of trauma includes experiences ranging from the
  highly personal to national and even global traumas. Some scholars support the
  understanding of trauma as an unspeakable experience, and survivors of the traumatic
  event are incapable of putting the experience into words. On the other hand, scholars
  also argue that by putting the traumatic event into a cohesive narrative, survivors of the
  trauma will be able to heal. By its very definition, trauma is unspeakable, yet the remedy
  for trauma is putting it into words, which ultimately renders healing inaccessible.
  Throughout this literature review, I will discuss how scholars in the field should: 1.)
  construct more inclusive definitions of healing; 2.) examine how rhetors enact
  fatherhood in discussing traumatic experiences; 3.) empower survivors of trauma to
  reclaim agency; 4.) draw on multiple narratives to construct honest and complex
  representations of trauma; 5.) engage with the discipline of disability studies; 6.) analyze
  how competing exigencies inform a rhetor&rsquo;s response to trauma; and 7.) determine
  when to address trauma from a pedagogical perspective.
</p>
<p>
  Because of the wide range of events encompassed within rhetorics of trauma, it
  is most efficient for me to divide up the scholarship into sub-sections according to the
  various purposes of the rhetoric of trauma. First, I will examine the definition of trauma
  and the events it encompasses. Then, I will discuss how the literature on the rhetoric of
  trauma facilitates healing; grapples with complexities of representation, especially
  concerning the Holocaust; creates community and/or dissonance; and contributes to
  pedagogy.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Types of Trauma</strong>
</p>
<p>
  It&rsquo;s worth examining what &ldquo;trauma&rdquo; usually means in this scholarship. According
  to Kai Erikson, as cited in Caruth, a personal trauma, as distinguished from a collective or
  social trauma, is &ldquo;a blow to the psyche that breaks through one&rsquo;s defenses so suddenly
  and with such brutal force that one cannot react to it effectively&rdquo; (&ldquo;Trauma&rdquo; 187). Such
  a definition, while helpful for understanding what constitutes a personal trauma, is also
  problematic as it relies on a perceived shortcoming on the part of the individual who has
  experienced trauma. This suggests that it is the individual&rsquo;s inability to mentally and
  physically withstand the traumatic event&mdash;rather than the event itself&mdash;that defines
  trauma. One could then use this definition as a platform to determine what it means for
  an individual to heal from a traumatic event: to learn to effectively respond to the
  trauma. I also take issue with the word &ldquo;effectively&rdquo; as I would argue that there is no
  way to effectively respond to trauma. In defining a collective trauma, Erikson states: &ldquo;By
  collective trauma, on the other hand, I mean a blow to the basic tissues of social life that
  damages the bonds attaching people together and impairs the prevailing sense of
  communality&rdquo; (&ldquo;Trauma&rdquo; 187). However, I would also disagree with this definition&mdash;
  after visiting the memorial constructed in response to the theater shooting in Aurora, it
  was apparent that this particular collective trauma brought the community together
  more than impaired it.
</p>
<p>
  Toward a more complicated definition of trauma, Caruth argues that trauma is
  more than just the instance or event that marked the individual, but rather &ldquo;the
  oscillation between a crisis of death and the correlative crisis of life&rdquo; (&ldquo;Unclaimed
  Experience&rdquo; 7). In other words, the traumatic event itself is ultimately just the
  beginning; it also encompasses the subsequent struggle for survival in the aftermath of
  a traumatic experience, the radically different existence of an individual who can no
  longer live way he or she did prior to the trauma. Dori Laub, as cited in Caruth, states,
  &ldquo;repossessing one&rsquo;s life story through giving testimony is itself a form of action&rdquo;
  (&ldquo;Trauma&rdquo; 70), demonstrating the need for survivors to communicate their experiences
  in a way that allows them to preserve agency. By doing so, a survivor is able to live one&rsquo;s
  life more fully. Because, according to Laub, the event itself &ldquo;invariably plays a decisive
  formative role in who one comes to be, and in how one comes to live one&rsquo;s life,&rdquo;
  (&ldquo;Trauma&rdquo; 70) the act of giving a testimony of the traumatic event allows survivors to
  establish their identity and history, reclaim positions as witnesses to the event, and
  choose how the experience fits into the bigger scheme of their life stories.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Facilitating Healing</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Much of the literature examines how the rhetoric of trauma can be used to
  facilitate healing; however, I would argue that many rhetorical approaches are
  inadequate when it comes to fully conveying a traumatic experience, which is
  problematic if communicating the experience is the easiest way for survivors to begin
  healing from trauma. Consequently, the research in this area focuses on ethos and the
  role of the rhetor in communicating one&rsquo;s own trauma, as well as the challenges that
  come with such a rhetorical context.
</p>
<p>
  Though narrative is an important method survivors of trauma utilize to
  communicate their experiences, the literature demonstrates that many rhetorical
  approaches fall short of fully conveying the experience. As Rosemary Winslow argues,
  ordinary language does not meet the demands of communicating about trauma because
  trauma is an extraordinary experience, which inherently makes it unspeakable. I would
  argue that it is only unspeakable to the extent that it others those who have not
  experienced the trauma. From my experience, what is unspeakable about trauma is the
  bond and the community that it instantly creates among those who have experienced
  the trauma. As Winslow states, rhetors communicating about the traumas they have
  experienced must rely on devices like tropes and metaphors because the trauma &ldquo;shifts
  the experience to preconceptual figural resources&rdquo; (609). As Caruth explains, tropes
  allow writing produced in response to trauma to become more focused on imagery and
  description. As she states, &ldquo;precisely when the text appears most human, it is most
  mechanical&rdquo; (&ldquo;Unclaimed Experience&rdquo; Caruth 82). Survivors can potentially utilize such
  devices&mdash;though they are often looked down upon in other forms of writing&mdash;to capture
  the otherwise unspeakable aspects of a trauma.
</p>
<p>
  Though scholars argue that tropes and metaphors may help survivors
  communicate their experience of trauma, many scholars address how post-traumatic
  stress disorder (PTSD) can exacerbate the unspeakable nature of a traumatic
  experience, making it more difficult for survivors to talk about. However, I would argue
  that if trauma is truly an unspeakable event, then there is no clear benefit to
  distinguishing between survivors of trauma who experience PTSD as opposed to those
  who don&rsquo;t. Because of the complex nature of traumatic memory in that it &ldquo;is evoked
  under particular conditions,&rdquo; as explained by Van Der Kolk and Van Der Hart as cited in
  Caruth (&ldquo;Trauma&rdquo; 163), trauma is not easily transferred into narrative, which is arguably
  the most effective way for survivors to process their own experiences of trauma. As a
  result, writing is not always therapeutic for survivors in the aftermath of a tragedy,
  which poses a problem for how healing is defined and assessed. As F.J. Van Zuuren et al.
  addresses, writing in response to trauma can exhibit characteristics of writing that is
  effective in general, though more research must be done on how writing can assist in
  the recovery process and help with PTSD. If PTSD is ultimately inevitable for survivors of
  trauma, which is not immediately clear based on the scholarship on the rhetoric of
  trauma, then I would suggest that scholars studying writing as a therapeutic tool discard
  the prerequisite of being able to formulate a narrative and look for other attributes that
  are more indicative of healing. Perhaps scholars should trace the usage of tropes and
  metaphors in survivors&rsquo; writings about their experiences of trauma, as a decline in the
  use of these devices may show that survivors rely less on generalizations to
  communicate their experiences with audiences who have no personal involvement with
  the traumatic event.
</p>
<p>
  Though much of the literature focuses on a more psychological perspective of
  healing, it is also important to note that some survivors have sustained physical injuries
  from the trauma they&rsquo;ve experienced, though most of the literature only examines how
  to facilitate healing psychologically or physically, not both simultaneously. I would
  contend that this perpetuates an oversimplified understanding of the body and what it
  means to heal from trauma. This is where trauma studies would benefit from more
  overlap with disability studies, since both disciplines share an emphasis on reform,
  especially in regards to challenging and recreating definitions of person as well as
  reclaiming agency. However, surprisingly, there is little interaction between the two
  fields. Considering the degree to which disability and trauma overlap in terms of their
  foci, James Berger questions why disability studies and trauma studies consider
  themselves to be mutually exclusive, stating, &ldquo;Both, after all, are concerned with
  devastating injury and its lasting effects; both place individual disability and trauma in
  broad social and historical contexts; both focus intensively on problematics of
  representation&rdquo; (563). Although, Berger does acknowledge the many ideological tenets
  that divide the two fields; for example, while trauma studies is shaped to a large extent
  by the use of metaphor, disability studies sees metaphor as ableist in that it tends to
  indicate a &ldquo;refusal to recognize and include disability, both as human experience and
  metaphoric phenomenon&rdquo; (Vidali 41). Ultimately, Berger suggests that &ldquo;trauma studies
  reveals certain theoretical blind spots in disability studies, while disability studies
  suggests political inadequacies in trauma studies&rdquo; (577), though it&rsquo;s quite ironic that he
  uses the phrase &ldquo;blind spots&rdquo; to make his point. It&rsquo;s evident from the gaps in each
  discipline that trauma studies would benefit greatly from more interaction with
  disability studies and vice versa, particularly in regards to understandings of healing and
  recovery from trauma and confronting expectations for survivors to cope or respond to
  trauma in certain socially acceptable ways.
</p>
<p>
  It is important for me to acknowledge that although the rhetoric of trauma
  places much emphasis on healing, the field does examine how survivors of a traumatic
  experience can write for purposes other than healing and recovery. As Amy Larsen
  describes in her article entitled &ldquo;&rsquo;I Was Ready for a Mending&rsquo;: Rhetorics of Trauma and
  Recovery in Doug Peacock's Grizzly Years and Walking It Off,&rdquo; her subject ultimately
  repurposed his narrative of trauma in order to garner support for grizzly bear
  conservation. Larsen analyzes how Doug Peacock, a veteran of the Vietnam War,
  repurposes trauma persuasively in his memoirs to garner support for his cause.
  Throughout his memoirs, Peacock reflects on his relationships with others while
  revisiting his actions and behaviors, and Larsen identifies this as evidence of his recovery
  process. I assert that such reflexivity may be another sign scholars of trauma rhetoric
  should look for in terms of assessing a survivor&rsquo;s writings for evidence of healing. By
  identifying with the audience, with the self, and with the other, his memoir highlights
  similarities among people&rsquo;s experiences of the Vietnam War but still &ldquo;respects
  differences and does not attempt to universalize them&rdquo; (Larsen 421), demonstrating
  how Peacock&rsquo;s memoir doesn&rsquo;t conform to the conventions of writing about trauma
  therapeutically. Instead, he repurposes his own traumas to advocate for a bigger goal
  aside from his personal rehabilitation. I would say this demonstrates that scholars
  should be more open-minded toward texts that don&rsquo;t fit the current narrowly defined
  idea of healing, which ultimately strips survivors of agency if they cannot form a
  cohesive narrative of their own traumatic experience.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Issues of Representation</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Overall, it is quite clear that scholars who study the rhetoric of trauma must
  grapple with many complex questions when evaluating how trauma is represented and
  by whom. No representation of trauma will ever capture the experience in its entirety to
  a degree that satisfies all those who endured it, no matter the trauma. On the one hand,
  a survivor is limited by his or her own traumatic memory in accurately portraying the
  trauma and compiling memories into a coherent narrative. In regards to public
  memorials, there is a constant reality that a memorial inherently favors one particular
  narrative over others, leading to the marginalization of narratives that do not match the
  story that is represented. The memorial in and of itself comes to stand in for the trauma
  as a whole, thereby silencing other perspectives or experiences of the trauma. The
  ethical qualms of such representation should not be overlooked. When confronted with
  the reality of history and the media as pursuits of truth, such issues of representation
  become more complicated. Such endeavors are often at odds with the reality of the
  traumas that survivors have experienced. History and the media are pursuing a truth
  that is ultimately unable to be represented, due to the vast diversity and range of
  experiences as well as the difficulty of putting those experiences into words.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Public Address and Speeches</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The literature in this field focuses on how rhetors choose to represent specific
  aspects of the event, especially in the context of a public trauma, and what they are
  ultimately responsible for in conveying the traumatic experience to an audience. In his
  article entitled, &ldquo;The Phenomenology of Disaster: Toward a Rhetoric of Tragedy,&rdquo; Robert
  Wade Kenny argues that rhetors who respond to tragedy have broader responsibilities
  that their texts must shoulder in that they must &ldquo;reveal something fundamental about
  the character of tragic rhetoric through a disclosure of some part of its human situation,
  understood as the phenomenology of the disaster&rdquo; (98). Rhetors who respond to
  disaster in the public realm are incapable of distancing themselves from the event once
  they have been exposed to it; consequently, such rhetors utilize rhetoric in an effort to
  ensure their own redemption from the tragedy (Kenny 100). This is in direct contrast to:
  1.) the audience, those who see the tragedy unfold through the media, as though it&rsquo;s a
  spectacle (Kenny 100) and 2.) the witnesses, who experience the disaster themselves
  (Kenny 112). As a result, the rhetor must provide &ldquo;solace&mdash;in the form of comfort,
  explanation, and direction&rdquo; (Kenny 112).
</p>
<p>
  Donyale Griffin-Padgett and Donnetrice Allison elaborate on the rhetor&rsquo;s
  responsibilities to the public in their article &ldquo;Making a Case for Restorative Rhetoric:
  Mayor Rudolph Giuliani &amp; Mayor Ray Nagin's Response to Disaster.&rdquo; As they argue,
  restorative rhetoric is the most appropriate tactic for those in positions of leadership to
  use when responding to a crisis or tragedy because it &ldquo;shifts postcrisis communication
  from reducing the offensiveness of the occurrence and maintaining a positive image, to
  facilitating dialogue between the public and crisis leaders, and helping victims and the
  general public to make sense of the crisis event&rdquo; (Griffin-Padgett and Allison 380). By
  doing so, leaders are able to represent the trauma not as a political stunt, but rather as
  a genuine effort to reach out and offer assistance and leadership. Because of the many
  complex ways trauma can be represented, as Kenny notes, it is essential to distinguish
  between the texts produced by survivors of a trauma and those who are in positions of
  leadership and feel obligated to respond, as they are coming from multiple, diverse
  perspectives with varying motives and intentions, depending heavily on the context and
  exigence of the trauma itself.
</p>
<p>
  Scholars have presented a rhetoric of renewal&mdash;similar to restorative rhetoric&mdash;
  as an alternative heuristic in the case of texts that respond to traumas. In regards to the
  literature that examines public leaders&rsquo; responses to trauma, there is a clear tension
  between the rhetor&rsquo;s need to maintain and bolster his or her image versus providing
  genuine leadership amidst a crisis. As Griffin-Padgett and Seeger examine in their article
  &ldquo;From Image Restoration to Renewal: Approaches for Understanding Post-Crisis
  Communication,&rdquo; much of the literature on responses to trauma from public figures has
  focused on the way these rhetors strive to represent themselves in a positive light.
  Because of this, Seeger and Griffin-Padgett argue for a discourse of renewal in response
  to crisis. This is different from Griffin-Padgett and Allison&rsquo;s argument in support of
  restorative rhetoric because the rhetoric of renewal &ldquo;involves a more generative and
  spontaneous dialogue that is shaped not just in response to the crisis itself, but by
  contextual and social dimensions that layer the crisis event and influence response to it&rdquo;
  (133).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Media Coverage</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Issues with representations of trauma are not just inherent in the very
  instantaneous texts produced by political leaders, but also in the problematic ways that
  the news media uses binaries when covering traumas. In a critical indictment of the
  media, Patricia Leavy, in her article entitled &ldquo;Writing 9/11 Memory in Other Political
  Struggles: American Journalists and Special Interest Groups as Complicit Partners in 9/11
  Political Appropriation&rdquo; goes so far as to say that journalists were complicit in the
  political appropriation of 9/11 in support of the Bush administration&rsquo;s agenda. She
  argues that the press refused to question the Bush administration&rsquo;s account of events
  thereby situating 9/11 outside of political discourse, positioning any political dissidents
  who questioned the official version of events as villains and equating Americans who
  supported Bush&rsquo;s agenda with the definition of patriotism, thereby fulfilling the
  traditional archetypes of the hero and villain and perpetuating their own overly
  simplistic good vs. evil binary. Both of these articles demonstrate the power of the press
  in isolating and marginalizing specific experiences of traumas. Leavy shows how the
  press is able to determine which traumas are worthy of national media coverage and
  how they should be represented. Her argument demonstrates the power of the media
  in how it is able to marginalize events and perspectives that do not fit the privileged
  white perception of trauma or adhere to a certain standardized narrative of the event.
  More pointedly, Leavy examines the way the media is able to control the narratives of
  trauma through its use of binaries&mdash;specifically a hero vs. villain binary as well as an
  implicit us vs. them&mdash;which Dan Berkowitz, addresses as well in his own examination of
  the rhetoric of trauma in the media.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, the literature examines how the American media&rsquo;s propensity for
  using binaries imposes clichéd representations of trauma on both domestic and foreign
  events, which risks denigrating the traumatic experience for the sake of making the
  event more accessible to general audiences. In &ldquo;Telling ‘Our&rsquo; Story Through News of
  Terrorism,&rdquo; Dan Berkowitz and Hillel Nossek contrast American and Israeli rhetoric in
  media coverage of various terrorist attacks. The authors draw larger conclusions about
  the role of narrative and archetypes as they pertain to American media coverage of
  international news stories, claiming that because foreign traumas are so distant from
  American audiences, newscasters face a unique challenge in attempting to make the
  story accessible. Berkowitz and Nossek address the binary inherent in deciding what
  perspective to use when covering a traumatic event: our story vs. their story. For our
  traumas, American journalists use archetypes to cast victims of the trauma in positive
  and heroic roles while terrorists or perpetrators of the crime become the villains; for
  their traumas, American media outlets make use of a Wild West narrative that situates
  supporters of American ideals and policies as the heroes who come to tame a land ruled
  by outlaws, otherwise known as those who maintain a blatantly anti-American agenda.
  Though Berkowitz and Nossek provide interesting insight into how cultural distance
  ultimately dictates the type of myth that journalists use to tell the story, their argument
  neglects the negative consequences of how trauma is represented by the media.
</p>
<p>
  Though Berkowitz acknowledges that American media constructs many
  obstacles to a productive conversation about trauma by bolstering shallow
  representations of trauma, he also contends that the 24-hour news cycle can still
  facilitate healing by highlighting the positive amidst tragedy. Berkowitz addresses the
  role of the media in the aftermath of tragedy and affirms its role as &ldquo;conveyor,
  translator, mediator, and meaning-maker&rdquo; (644), distinguishing between the power of
  news pieces and editorials in his article entitled &ldquo;The Ironic Hero of Virginia Tech:
  Healing Trauma Through Mythical Narrative and Collective Memory.&rdquo; Through a textual
  analysis of news coverage responding to the Virginia Tech shooting, he examines both
  irony and the role of archetypal narratives. Berkowitz argues that narrative is important
  in the healing process because of society&rsquo;s quest for heroes. He also shows that an ironic
  hero can be more facilitative of healing than a simple archetypal hero. In the case of
  Virginia Tech, an ironic hero who is tied to the collective memory of another tragedy can
  emphasize &ldquo;all the good that exists in society despite its troubles&rdquo; (Berkowitz 652). His
  analysis is useful for understanding the rhetoric of trauma when coupled with the
  growing influence of the 24-hour news cycle because he shows how the media can
  potentially facilitate healing amidst tragedy in spite of its problematic representations of
  various traumas and the people associated with them. However, Berkowitz&rsquo;s argument
  about irony lacks the degree of support used to justify the role of the mythic hero and
  neglects to consider why irony is so common in this context.
</p>
<p>
  Though narrative allows for a more emotional approach to media coverage of
  traumas, Berkowitz demonstrates how the media utilizes narrative to reshape the
  experiences of trauma survivors in order to meet the needs of an audience. As
  Berkowitz argues throughout his work, narrative allows for traumas to be conveyed to
  the audience in a way that is more accessible, as much of the trauma that does occur is
  often difficult to explain or discuss. Narrative bridges this gap by portraying trauma in a
  recognizable form, one that is often easier for audiences to digest and manage.
  Additionally, Berkowitz shows how archetypes, much like narrative, allow for otherwise
  inaccessible persons or characters in a narrative to fit a predisposed mold or figure,
  enabling audiences to understand who these people are and what motivates them by
  positioning them on extreme ends of the spectrum.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The Holocaust</strong>
</p>
<p>
  In addition to examining how media coverage complicates representations of
  trauma, much of the literature delves into the complexities of how traumas are
  permanently commemorated in a public forum, which is particularly pertinent in regards
  to the problem of memorializing the Holocaust. In her book, Trauma and the Memory of
  Politics, Jenny Edkins asks, &ldquo;To what extent is there a type of ‘truth&rsquo; that is beyond
  telling, beyond narrative, that a straightforward linear narrative or an objective
  historical account misses?&rdquo; (117) This question guides much of the research that
  explores how the Holocaust and other traumas should be represented in contemporary
  culture, through texts including films and public memorials. For example, Edkins
  describes how when Holocaust survivors first met their liberators, the survivors had
  epiphanies about the sheer difficulty of telling the stories and narratives of their own
  personal horrors. As she explains it: &ldquo;It is precisely that which lies outside the linguistic
  or symbolic order that circumscribes what we call social reality&rdquo; (111). The realization
  that their stories would not be so easily transferred to words would ultimately shape
  the way that the Holocaust would be represented in collective memory.
</p>
<p>
  On the one hand, scholars recognize the importance of accurately portraying the
  events of the Holocaust through the words of the victims and survivors themselves; on
  the other hand, scholars understand that these individuals are not necessarily capable
  of presenting a coherent and cohesive narrative of their trauma that can be utilized in a
  historical account of the Holocaust. This tension in turn creates an ethical dilemma,
  pitting obligations to the past against respect for survivors&rsquo; experiences of the trauma.
  In his article entitled &ldquo;The Rhetoric of Disaster and the Imperative of Writing,&rdquo; Michael
  Bernard-Donals argues for a rhetoric of disaster that doesn&rsquo;t produce knowledge and
  explores what this means in relation to the mantra &ldquo;always remember,&rdquo; which is often
  repeated in the aftermath of tragedy. He focuses on the role of eyewitness testimony
  after tragedy and argues that it isn&rsquo;t a reliable form of evidence when it comes to
  traumatic events. First, the ethos of the eyewitness is compromised because there is a
  gap between what is witnessed and what that person can say about it. The authenticity
  of the testimony can also be seen as questionable, especially if the author struggles to
  convey the experience in a way that readers will understand. Because eyewitness
  testimony may not function according to traditional rhetorical expectations, analyzing it
  from a traditional rhetorical perspective is insufficient; instead, there must be a
  separate rhetoric of disaster and social trauma. This article is significant because it
  challenges an ethical imperative associated with trauma and poses the consequences of
  continually enforcing it with an expectation that texts in response to trauma should
  produce knowledge.
</p>
<p>
  In their collection of essays, Witnessing Disaster: Essays on Representation and
  the Holocaust, Bernard-Donals and Richard R. Glejzer, alongside other authors,
  acknowledge the problems with viewing eyewitness testimony as evidence due to the
  compromised nature of the rhetor while trying to reconcile this perspective with other
  potential ways to represent the Holocaust. In spite of this, the authors aim to
  demonstrate that the Holocaust can indeed be subject to representation, despite its
  historic and personal distance from many who are alive today. Because the sheer depth
  and severity of the tragedy almost guarantee that no account will fully represent its
  impact, Bernard-Donals and Glejzer&rsquo;s efforts seem quite lofty. But this dilemma is not
  uncommon across the literature of trauma, particularly in relation to the Holocaust.
  As scholars have noted, traumas can be oriented rhetorically as teachable
  moments in order to avoid potential issues of representation and problematic narratives
  all together by grappling with the issue of deriving meaning from traumatic events
  instead of ensuring historical accuracy. Edkins discusses how the historical distance from
  the Holocaust has resulted in many recent memorials taking on a more overtly
  pedagogic role with rather explicit representations of the Holocaust experience&mdash;for
  example, at a memorial in Boston, the use of imitations of crematoriums at
  extermination camps in Nazi Germany in order to deliver a more overt message about
  the harsh reality of genocide (124). Such controversial memorials prompt the question,
  which narratives and experiences should be preserved through public memorials? As
  the literature demonstrates, there is very little consensus on the extent to which
  personal narratives should inform public memorials, or how these narratives should
  shape a more historical understanding of traumatic events in their entirety. This not
  only challenges an individual&rsquo;s testimony of a trauma, but also the larger social
  narratives of traumas that are constructed around such witnesses. The tension between
  history and collective memory highlights the problematic nature of memorials that are
  designed to facilitate a singular perspective on the event itself, compared to the many
  multifaceted ways the trauma was experienced by those who endured it.
</p>
<p>
  Much of Caruth&rsquo;s work complicates the notion of memory in relation to trauma,
  demonstrating the complexities of representing traumas accurately through historical
  accounts. On the one hand, she advocates for &ldquo;the possibility of a history that is no
  longer straightforwardly referential (that is, no longer based on simple models of
  experience and reference)&rdquo; (Caruth &ldquo;Unclaimed Experience&rdquo; 11). She seems to suggest
  that a more incomplete account of history is likely inevitable when attempting to
  chronicle the nature of various traumas, or that history must be shaped differently
  when it includes trauma. At the same time, understanding &ldquo;that history, like trauma, is
  never simply one&rsquo;s own, that history is precisely the way we are implicated in each
  other&rsquo;s traumas&rdquo; (Caruth &ldquo;Unclaimed Experience&rdquo; 24) may be key in producing a more
  collaborative history that portrays the complex relationships between individuals and
  groups in the face of trauma, rather than relying on fragmented individual narratives.
  However, there is a clear ethical dilemma in the midst of creating a historical account of
  trauma: &ldquo;the unremitting problem of how not to betray the past&rdquo; (Caruth &ldquo;Unclaimed
  Experience&rdquo; 27). On the one hand, there is always a desire to accurately portray the
  events of the past; however, it is likely that to some degree, this is not always possible
  or feasible, resulting in an incomplete picture of a traumatic event.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Creating Community and/or Dissonance</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Scholars have analyzed how rhetors enact their social roles to establish ethos
  and communicate their experiences of trauma, ultimately creating a sense of
  community and/or dissonance. In her article entitled, &ldquo;Communicating Trauma: Female
  Survivors Witnessing the No Gun Ri Killings,&rdquo; Suhi Choi delves into the ways women who
  survived or witnessed the No Gun Ri Killings in the Korean war tell their story and
  communicate their suffering to others. As Choi argues, these women filter their
  experiences through the lens of motherhood. Each woman defines other women in the
  community who survived the trauma as a disappeared, dedicated or survived mother,
  but Choi argues that motherhood is a &ldquo;double-edged rhetorical device&rdquo; (30). It allows
  these women to bond with each other not only as survivors of the same event, but also
  as a community of mothers. However, as Choi explains, &ldquo;the concept of Confucian
  motherhood has enabled the No Gun Ri female rhetors to articulate their otherwise
  unspeakable memories; yet on the other hand, it has provoked the female narrators to
  judge their own and their loved ones&rsquo; experiences in the war through the filter of a strict
  morality code that leads to guilt and blame&rdquo; (30). This demonstrates how trauma has
  the potential to compromise survivors&rsquo; own social roles and self-perceptions, and
  therefore, their ethos, which resonates with Bernard-Donals&rsquo; argument about how
  trauma detracts from a rhetor&rsquo;s credibility. However, both articles fail to consider how
  survivors of trauma could potentially regain ethos&mdash;for example, in circumstances other
  than when they attempt to provide an accurate historical account of the event&mdash;or how
  rhetors can incorporate appeals other than ethos in order to build community.
</p>
<p>
  The power of motherhood as a provocative rhetorical tool for establishing both
  ethos and pathos with a given audience has not gone unnoticed in the work of other
  scholars. Nancy Miller&rsquo;s article, &ldquo;The Girl in the Photograph: The Vietnam War and the
  Making of Natural Memory&rdquo; explores how the notorious young Vietnamese girl featured
  in the photograph that came to represent the undiscerning horrors of the Vietnam War
  established agency through her role as a mother. To solidify this sense of agency, the
  woman in the photograph took a second picture, but while holding her son and
  highlighting her scars from the napalm. In both Choi and Miller&rsquo;s articles, motherhood is
  used to explain the trauma experienced by the rhetors. For the rhetors in Choi&rsquo;s piece,
  this can also be used to cast moral judgment on other members of the community,
  while in Miller&rsquo;s piece, the motherhood angle is particularly poignant seeing as how the
  Vietnamese woman has transitioned from a vulnerable young girl to a mother. By using
  motherhood as a tool to speak the unspeakable, these women are able to provide
  others with more insight into their experiences. In media coverage of traumas involving
  women, the notion of motherhood is exploited to exacerbate the impact or significance
  of an event, or in the case of terrorism, to place an additional layer of blame on the
  woman for abandoning and traumatizing her relatives (Berkowitz &ldquo;Suicide Bombers as
  Women Warriors&rdquo;). I contend that this use of the ethos of motherhood when discussing
  trauma creates a sense of dissonance among those who identify as mothers and may
  experience a range of reactions to a suicide bomber who claims to have acted in the
  best interest of her children. It is important for scholars to consider how effectively
  other social roles, when juxtaposed with certain types of traumas, may establish ethos
  in order to elicit certain responses from audiences.
</p>

  A very clear gap here is the lack of literature on fatherhood as a form of ethos
  through which to communicate trauma and ultimately build community or create
  dissonance. By excluding the role and impact of fatherhood in communicating tragedy,
  the literature does two things: it reinforces the stereotypical emotional connotations
  associated with motherhood, neglects the equally emotional role of fathers, and
  perpetuates a perception of absentee fathers uninvolved in the lives of their children.
  Scholars have observed other ways the media creates dissonance when covering
  traumatic events, in addition to its invocation of familiar social roles that resonate with
  audiences. Leavy and Maloney argue that the media portrays certain traumas as
  national events while marginalizing other traumas, thereby pitting survivors of national
  traumas against those who experienced traumas not worthy of being perceived as a
  major event. Specifically, the authors compare Columbine and the Red Lake School
  shootings, arguing that while each shared similar characteristics, Columbine become a
  national trauma while Red Lake School was quickly forgotten. This is because the media
  prioritized Columbine due to the primarily white and middle-class demographic of the
  victims, while Red Lake School was marginalized because it mostly affected a lower-class
  community consisting of many Native Americans. The authors question the
  predominantly white and middle class audience that the press seems to be targeting
  and take issue with the fact that such a bias may marginalize or diminish the impact of
  other similar traumas, perpetuating white privilege and demeaning the lower classes. I
  argue that because such treatment from the press isolates those have experienced
  &ldquo;lesser&rdquo; traumas, it could be likened to another form of trauma, as those who
  experienced the forgotten trauma must now defend the significance of their own
  experience.

  More recent scholarship focuses on the way survivors of trauma utilize digital
  mediums to share their experiences with like-minded people and ultimately build
  community. As Riki Thompson explores in her article &ldquo;Understanding Trauma &amp; the
  Rhetoric of Recovery: A Discourse Analysis of Virtual Healing Journals of Child Sexual
  Abuse Survivors,&rdquo; digital environments allow for a more accessible and public place for
  survivors to share their stories and process their grief with others. Though in
  Thompson&rsquo;s example, the survivors are inherently bound by the common experience of
  sexual abuse, it is not until they own and claim that experience in a public forum, like an
  online discussion board, that they become a part of the community. Similarly, as Maya
  Socolovsky investigates in her article &ldquo;Cyber-Spaces of Grief: Online Memorials and the
  Columbine High School Shootings,&rdquo; the internet also allows friends and family of those
  who have died in a trauma to share their memories and experiences of grief with each
  other. Such a space provides a much-needed outlet for those who have survived a
  trauma or lost a loved one in a trauma, allowing them to connect with a newfound
  community established through their connections to a particular trauma. While I would
  say these actions indicate the way trauma has become a part of survivors&rsquo; identities, I
  would also suggest that those who are impacted by this trauma must choose to claim it
  as part of their identity, which could certainly be viewed as a sign of healing. By joining
  an online community, survivors are ultimately acknowledging the impact the trauma has
  made on their lives and allowing it to shape their ethos by reaching out to others who
  may also be motivated to come to terms with how the traumatic event has shaped their
  lives.
</p>
<p>
  Scholars also note the importance of recognizing how inflicting Western
  understandings of trauma on other cultures may create dissonance by further
  marginalizing survivors of traumas. By imposing Western views on those who belong to
  other cultures and have experienced trauma, scholars risk stripping these survivors of
  agency and neglecting the cultural nuances that may or may not shape their traumas in
  a different way, which Cynthia Zarowsky addresses in her article, &ldquo;Writing Trauma:
  Emotion, Ethnography, and the Politics of Suffering among Somali Returnees in
  Ethiopia.&rdquo; Not only does this marginalize those who react to trauma in a way that does
  not adhere to Western expectations, but it also risks perpetuating the problematic idea
  that there is a right way to respond to trauma, when in reality, survivors process their
  own experiences in a way that is unique to their personalities, their cultures, and their
  traumas. However, the reality is that those who share experiences of trauma may act
  first in the interest of their own survival, both as individuals and as a group because the
  trauma itself can empower and connect those who have experienced it. Much like how
  the media perpetuates a hierarchy of importance in deciding which traumas are
  national, I assert that scholars who view or analyze the experiences of non-Western
  peoples through a Western lens risk inflicting their perspective on other traumas while
  marginalizing those whose experiences do not adhere to Western expectations.

  <strong>Section 1.01 Pedagogies of Trauma</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Much of the pedagogy of trauma aims to determine how to address trauma in
  the classroom appropriately and effectively. Though much of the literature delves into
  potential pedagogical approaches, such as free-writing and class discussion, a
  conversation about which traumas to respond to in the classroom and why is noticeably
  absent from the scholarship.
</p>
<p>
  As a composition instructor who has observed how 9/11 continues to shape
  public discourse, I agree with scholars&rsquo; assertions that in the wake of 9/11, a new
  approach to composition pedagogy is necessary. In his anthology, Trauma and the
  Teaching of Writing, Shane Borrowman states that 9/11 is ultimately the exigency that
  motivates the collection. Furthermore, he acknowledges the difficulties of organizing
  the essays in this book but explains that they &ldquo;exist within a tapestry of understanding
  and experience, where history, memory, and trauma cross with pedagogy and
  rhetoric/composition theory&rdquo; (Borrowman 4). The book itself reinforces the notion that
  there is a wide range of responses to trauma, and the implication of this is that there are
  many ways to teach in times of trauma. It envisions the composition classroom as a
  place where images of trauma are reimagined, meaning is created, narratives are
  explored, culture is critiqued, and texts can be re-appropriated. The diversity of this text
  is its strongest aspect&mdash;not only do authors write about a variety of traumas in multiple
  historical and social contexts, but they also allow for myriad understandings of the
  composition classroom&rsquo;s role when it comes to teaching students in times of trauma.
  Also motivated by 9/11 and the impact of social trauma on writing, Robin M.
  Murphy&rsquo;s book, How Social Trauma Affects How We Write: Post 9/11 Rhetorical Theory
  and Composition Pedagogy, addresses the same concerns about how to incorporate
  crisis and trauma into the classroom. On the one hand, she argues that a post-9/11
  rhetorical theory should pose &ldquo;a contemporary approach to fostering citizenship&rdquo;
  (Murphy 17), challenging previous definitions and understandings of patriotism and
  dissent. Though 9/11 itself represented not only the vulnerability of landmarks, but also
  American values like patriotism and democracy, Murphy hopes to challenge teachers
  and students alike to develop digital literacy in order to critically examine the cultural
  artifacts produced in response to crises like 9/11, instead of simply situating such
  artifacts outside of critical discourse due to their association with traumatic and painful
  events. The author also demonstrates the important of envisioning citizenship from a
  more global and intercultural perspective in order to reconcile oneself with the reality of
  a rapidly evolving network of nations and cultures. Ultimately, this will not only
  challenge students to become more critical consumers of culture, but will also prepare
  students to write and compose in a multimodal world.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, James Moffett, as cited in Marian M. MacCurdy&rsquo;s anthology The Mind&rsquo;s
  Eye: Image and Memory in Writing about Trauma, also advocates for a post-9/11
  pedagogy. As Moffett states, 9/11 &ldquo;began a national conversation about trauma and
  healing that could not be accomplished by two world wars, institutionalized racism, the
  Vietnam ‘conflict,&rsquo; the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, and countless
  tragic school shootings that hit us where we are the most vulnerable&mdash;our children&rdquo;
  (55). Moffett focuses specifically on the exceedingly visual and symbolic nature of 9/11;
  as he notes, that first image of the tragedy was shocking, but over time, the influence
  and impact of that image fades, which is ultimately where he thinks teachers can
  intervene and facilitate the development of only &ldquo;a sadness that becomes integrated
  into the rest of life&rdquo; (57). In response to the texts that students produce in the wake of a
  tragedy, the instructor&rsquo;s job is to let the student know what the text makes visible in
  pursuit of a narrative that reflects an emotional truth of some sort. By evaluating how a
  student&rsquo;s words replicate the truth that he or she wants to convey, the teacher becomes
  a guide, assisting students in representing the depth of their own emotional journeys
  through writing.
</p>
<p>
  Because composition courses may favor end goals that focus on a student&rsquo;s own
  identity and sense of self, scholars also examine how teachers may feel obligated to
  fulfill additional roles within the classroom by responding to a student&rsquo;s disclosure of
  trauma in a particular way. As Charles M. Anderson and Marian MacCurdy explore in
  their anthology, Writing and Healing: Toward an Informed Practice, the nature of the
  composition classroom allows for more expressivist writing, which may cause teachers
  who are unsure of how to respond to feel more like therapists rather than writing
  instructors. In their introduction of the anthology, Anderson and MacCurdy set out to
  explore how teachers utilize &ldquo;their expertise as writing professionals, writers, and
  human beings to help students create texts that embody their lived experience, the
  clearest expression of it, and whatever understanding of that experience is available to
  the student&rdquo; (9). Throughout their anthology, the editors examine how writing is a form
  of healing in addition to how the writing classroom itself can forge connections for
  composition instructors within their profession and for students across the university
  and to the past. At times, I have felt the need to fulfill the role of a therapist for my
  students who have experienced trauma, though I have found no easy way to establish
  boundaries while encouraging my students to use writing as a way to process their
  experiences and responses. I acknowledge that with certain open-ended writing
  assignments, it might be a valuable pursuit to encourage a student to work through
  their experiences with trauma in writing. However, I&rsquo;m still uncertain about how to
  establish boundaries and avoid playing the therapist role with students who disclose
  experiences of trauma out of necessity. Many of the anecdotes in this anthology provide
  valuable insight into how to forge productive and appropriate relationships with these
  students in the classroom, but not when they step outside of those boundaries and
  attempt to discuss trauma with me as a confidant, which is certainly part of the territory
  of being a teacher.
</p>
<p>
  While the collection acknowledges the therapeutic function of writing, the
  emphasis is on the way students and teachers may write about trauma in order to
  engage more meaningfully with key tenants of composition pedagogy. Anderson and
  MacCurdy document such connections, including how the complexities of
  representation relate to one&rsquo;s own identity and sense of self; how the self can be
  viewed as &ldquo;transformative, as socially engaged, as open to revision&rdquo; (87); how rhetoric
  provides students with &ldquo;strategies for coping&rdquo; and &ldquo;equipment for living&rdquo; (37); how
  students can utilize narrative to &ldquo;suture&rdquo; themselves into the discourse of an other
  (190); how weaving experiences into a comprehensive narrative can facilitate recovery
  (89); and how essays documenting oppression can be used to critique existing power
  structures and ideologies (153). Because all writing is essentially rooted in personal
  experience, composition can provide students with lenses and perspectives that they
  can apply to other aspects of their lives, demonstrating the transferability of the skills
  they learn in the writing classroom and how those skills can help students make sense of
  their own traumas in a meaningful way.
</p>

  As R.D. Samuels examines, teachers can serve as guides while helping students
  navigate their own responses to texts that deal with traumatic events. In this case,
  Samuels aims to teach students how to analyze their own responses to a film set during
  the Holocaust by first examining internet users&rsquo; responses to the film, which is
  chronicled in his article, &ldquo;The Rhetoric of Trauma: Teaching about the Holocaust and
  Postmodern Affect in an Advanced Composition Course.&rdquo; The assignment itself was
  structured to focus on &ldquo;four modes of emotional denial in responding to texts about
  trauma: identifying, idealizing, universalizing, and assimilating&rdquo; (Samuels 450). First,
  Samuels defines universalizing as the belief that &ldquo;that there is no inherent meaning or
  value of the representation&rdquo; (451). He defines identifying as when &ldquo;people defend
  against history by concentrating on their own emotional responses to the historical
  representation&rdquo; (Samuels 452). To illustrate idealizing, Samuels explains that, &ldquo;By
  refocusing the effect of the film onto the effect that it has on their own selves, these
  students end up idealizing both the creator of the film and their own personal values&rdquo;
  (453). Lastly, assimilating is &ldquo;not only to absorb something into a new context but also
  to play upon recognizable themes and attributes for a generalized audience&rdquo; (Samuels
  454). As the author determines, &ldquo;by having students write about their emotional states
  in a critical way, teachers can help to avoid the pitfalls&rdquo; of these modes (Samuels 463).
  Through confronting and challenging students&rsquo; inwardly focused responses, Samuels
  demonstrates how composition teachers are able to turn discussions of trauma into
  more productive conversations without feeling the need to sacrifice such a goal for the
  integrity of each student&rsquo;s psyche.
</p>
<p>
  Discussion serves an equally important role in Diana Kardia et al.&rsquo;s article
  &ldquo;Discussing the Unfathomable: Classroom-based Responses to Tragedy,&rdquo; which aims to
  provide helpful guidelines for instructors leading class discussion in the aftermath of
  9/11. The guidelines themselves focus mostly on creating a safe space for students to
  voice opinions (and ensuring that the conversation stays respectful and open-minded),
  guiding and responding to displays of emotion, and contextualizing the discussion by
  identifying student concerns and establishing goals for the conversation. In spite of the
  difficulties of such discussions, the authors highlight the value of students collectively
  addressing &ldquo;the difficult questions posed by community tragedy&rdquo; (Kardia et al. 22). By
  successfully leading this sort of conversation, a writing teacher can help students
  understand the need for listening and an ability to think through information while
  exploring connections to their own personal experiences.
</p>
<p>
  While some of the literature examines how trauma can be a unifying experience
  in the classroom, other scholars argue that the classroom also favors certain traumas
  over others. Daphne Read&rsquo;s article &ldquo;Writing Trauma, History, Story: The Class(room) as
  Borderland&rdquo; examines the writing classroom as a borderland when focusing on how
  trauma cuts across social categories and communities that are anchored in typical forms
  of identity. This can &ldquo;privilege individuals and personal experience&rdquo; (Read 116), allowing
  the class to function as an imagined community; however, Read claims that writing
  about trauma in the classroom is only acceptable if those traumas are &ldquo;already
  legitimized in the public and academic spheres or forcefully articulated by strong social
  movements&rdquo; (116), posing problems for students writing about taboo traumas like
  sexual violence. Amidst other literature on trauma, this reconceptualization of trauma
  as a unifying experience is an unusual voice, which can aid instructors who strive to
  encourage narrative and expressivist writing in the classroom as a unifying experience.
  In conjunction with acknowledging that certain traumas are privileged and silenced in
  the classroom, such an understanding can also open up conversations about victimblaming
  and the taboo nature of certain experiences. As a composition instructor
  myself, however, I would attest to the difficulty of engaging students in this type of
  discussion, though it would ultimately be worth tackling. It would be necessary to
  establish certain guidelines and moderations to avoid pressuring students to divulge or
  disclose their own experiences with trauma. This is where pedagogies of trauma would
  benefit from more interaction with disability studies, which often grapples with issues of
  disclosure.
</p>
<p>
  The classroom as a space for collectively working through trauma is an important
  aspect of the literature on the rhetoric of trauma. Matthew J. Newcomb examines the
  complex relationship between space, suffering, and absence in the aftermath of 9/11.
  Much of the article is centered around how to talk about trauma in the classroom, what
  sort of spaces are created and utilized in the aftermath of tragedy, and how those
  spaces play a role in recovery. After tragedy, spaces can provide the means for
  cooperation&mdash;essential for starting the healing process&mdash;through the use of listening
  and asking questions. Physical space can also &ldquo;assist us in exposing how values for a
  story are created, hidden, and shifted,&rdquo; (Newcomb 757) offering insight into what voices
  are silenced or given a public forum. Newcomb connects this sense of absence to
  writing when he states, &ldquo;writing about suffering involves recontextualizing absences so
  that they will have direct uses for other specific groups&rdquo; (776). At times, Newcomb&rsquo;s
  work is complex and difficult to follow due to the extensive yet necessary attention that
  he gives to multiple voices, ranging from the students in his class to his Muslim
  neighbor, in the aftermath of 9/11. However, Newcomb&rsquo;s work serves to highlight the
  way trauma can create absences and how one fundamental motivation in response to
  trauma is to fill the absence with some kind of presence, whether it&rsquo;s a memorial or
  something else. Taking this into account in the aftermath of a trauma would be valuable
  for a composition teacher to do in the classroom; free writing or discussion may be a
  small but therapeutic strategy that students can grasp onto in order to feel as though
  they are filling some sort of gap in response to the trauma at hand.
</p>
<p>
  One potential gap within the pedagogical literature on trauma is deciding when
  and how to address a trauma, or in other words, which traumas are worthy of
  addressing in the classroom? Clearly, traumas that are deemed national may be more
  likely to permeate the lives of students through the news, but local traumas as well may
  be hard to ignore. As an instructor, this is one of my biggest challenges in the classroom,
  yet the current literature does little to help me rectify this problem. To me, this is a
  gross oversight, as much of the scholarship either tackles tragedies that are impossible
  to ignore, like 9/11, or simply assumes that instructors know when they must address a
  trauma in the classroom. I would argue that scholars must take a step back and first
  examine what merits the definition of trauma and how an instructor should ultimately
  decide which traumas to bring up for discussion in the classroom. Is it simply based on
  the scope or severity of the tragedy, or does such a decision depend more on the
  demographics of the classroom itself? The literature currently brings me no closer to
  answering these questions, which I hope to engage with more meaningfully later on in
  my analysis.
