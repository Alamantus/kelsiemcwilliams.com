  An Excerpt from &ldquo;The Prefrontal Cortex and the Criminal Justice System&rdquo;<br />

  When it comes to issue of punishment, justice, and rehabilitation for criminals,
  the pre-frontal cortex is of instrumental value. Damage sustained to the pre-frontal
  cortex has been proven to alter an individual&rsquo;s personality and behavior. Consequently,
  those who exhibit antisocial or sociopathic behavior but have no clear or verified record
  of pre-frontal cortex damage are often the most puzzling cases. Thus, when assessing an
  individual&rsquo;s liability for crimes he or she has committed, it is crucial to differentiate
  between an individual&rsquo;s understanding of right vs. wrong and ability to control deviant
  behavior.

<p>
  A low functioning pre-frontal cortex indicates that an individual knows the moral
  decision to make but chooses not to control his or her immoral desires. According to
  Salposky (2004), sociopaths must activate more of the pre-frontal cortex than control
  individuals in order to achieve comparable efficacy, as demonstrated by
  neuropsychological testing. In other words, when sociopathic individuals do attempt to
  regulate their behavior, their pre-frontal cortex is naturally less effective. Congruently,
  Salposky shows that those with a smaller volume of the pre-frontal cortex are more
  naturally inclined to engage in aggressive and violent behavior. Therefore, because this
  individual knows the difference between right and wrong, the justice system will hold
  this person responsible for any crimes he or she has committed. However, the justice
  system does not take into account an individual&rsquo;s limited executive function and ability
  to regulate behavior. This ultimately calls into question the justice system&rsquo;s criteria for
  guilt being dependent on one&rsquo;s ability to understand the difference between right and
  wrong. Instead, verdicts could arguably be considered more just if they weighed an
  individual&rsquo;s ability to control immoral behavior more heavily.

  Although sociopaths may exhibit a biological predisposition for aggression and
  difficulty regulating behavior, these individuals are still expected to be functioning
  members of society who do not infringe on the rights of others. However, the justice
  system could benefit from treating sociopaths differently than those with fully
  functioning pre-frontal cortexes when making decisions regarding punishment and
  rehabilitation. While complete rehabilitation is not necessarily likely or even realistic,
  some rehabilitation is possible. By working to rehabilitate sociopaths through better
  regulation of behavior, whether it be through additional testing, behavioral exercises, or
  some other consistent form of therapy, the legal system may be able to tread uncharted
  territory and ultimately decrease the likelihood of sociopathic criminal behavior. To
  simply prescribe the same punishment for all individuals guilty of a crime, regardless of
  impairment in prefrontal cortex functioning, is to negate the fact that sociopaths exhibit
  atypical neurological functions. Such a negation suggests that the application of
  punishment is indiscriminate thereby calling presumptions of fairness and morality in
  the justice system into question.
